This repository contains scripts and templates related to monitoring Ethernet OAM in commonly used monitoring applications.

[SURFsara](http://www.surfsara.nl/) is actively involved in investigating possibilities regarding this subject.

Currently there are two subdirectories:

* Icinga
* Cacti

Please refer to the [Eth-OAM Wiki](https://github.com/sara-nl/eth-oam/wiki/Ethernet-OAM-in-Icinga-and-Cacti---HOWTO) for more detailed information.
